Feature: Event Listen Timeouts
  Whenever a listen subscribe or unsubscribe event does not recieve
  an acknolowdgement from the server the client should emit an ack
  timeout error so that the client can attempt to retry.

  Scenario: The client is connected
    Given the test server is ready
    And the client is initialised
    And the server sends the message C|A+
    And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
    And the server sends the message A|A+

  #Scenario: The client listens to eventPrefix
    When the client listens to events matching "eventPrefix/.*"
    Then the last message the server recieved is E|L|eventPrefix/.*+

  #Scenario: The server does not respond in time with a listen ACK
    #When some time passes
    #Then the client throws a "ACK_TIMEOUT" error with message "No ACK message received in time for eventPrefix/.*"

  #Scenario: The client unlistens to eventPrefix
    When the client unlistens to events matching "eventPrefix/.*"
    Then the last message the server recieved is E|UL|eventPrefix/.*+

  #Scenario: The server does not respond in time with an unlisten ACK
    #When some time passes
    #Then the client throws a "ACK_TIMEOUT" error with message "No ACK message received in time for eventPrefix/.*"
